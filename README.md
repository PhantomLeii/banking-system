# Nebula Banking

This is a very loose clone of the functionality of internet banking applications. I did not develop it focusing on any specific real life mechaninsm of how internet banking works. This is purely, practice based and only indicates my skill when it comes to handling software development (Full Stack) as it stands.

## Descritption
The application consists of all the basic functionality that any web app consists of.

> Recreate the software and follow along with the documentation to understand how to use the application.
